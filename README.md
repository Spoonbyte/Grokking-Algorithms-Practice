# Grokking-Algorithms-Practice

This is to practice the algorithms I come across as I work my way through the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava. 
It will serve as a way for me to continue practicing coding while I look for side projects to work on. 
I will try to do the problems in C++ even though the book is written for python.
